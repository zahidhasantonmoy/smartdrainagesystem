🌍 TACKLING URBAN FLOODING WITH TECHNOLOGY 🌊 | Introducing Flowguard EcoControl - My IoT Solution Making Cities Safer!

I'm thrilled to showcase my capstone project that merges environmental consciousness with cutting-edge technology - a Smart Drainage System that could revolutionize urban infrastructure management!

🏙️ THE CHALLENGE:
Urban flooding affects millions worldwide each year, causing billions in damages and disrupting lives. Traditional drainage systems lack real-time monitoring, leading to preventable disasters.

💡 MY SOLUTION:
Flowguard EcoControl - an end-to-end IoT ecosystem combining hardware sensors with a sleek Android dashboard that transforms passive drainage systems into proactive guardians of our cities.

🚀 KEY INNOVATIONS I ENGINEERED:
• Real-time monitoring of 3 drainage chambers with animated water level visualization
• Intelligent blockage detection using dual sonar sensors + IR obstacle detection
• Safety-first design with methane gas & flame monitoring capabilities
• GPS-enabled location tracking with one-tap map navigation
• Remote plastic cutter control via Firebase for autonomous blockage removal
• Live data synchronization ensuring 24/7 system awareness
• Futuristic UI/UX with Material Design principles

🔧 TECH STACK:
Java | Android | Firebase Realtime Database | Sensor Integration | Google Maps API

🌱 IMPACT & VALUE:
This system empowers city authorities with predictive maintenance capabilities, potentially reducing flood-related damages by up to 60% while enhancing public safety through hazard detection.

The project demonstrates my ability to architect full-stack IoT solutions that address real environmental challenges while delivering intuitive user experiences.
