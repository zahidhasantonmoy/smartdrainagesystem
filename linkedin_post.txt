Excited to share my latest IoT project - Flowguard EcoControl: A Smart Drainage System! ðŸŒŠðŸ’¡

This Android application is part of an innovative IoT solution designed to prevent urban flooding and environmental hazards through real-time monitoring and control of drainage systems. 

Key features I developed:
â€¢ Real-time monitoring of water levels across 3 drainage chambers with visual indicators
â€¢ Detection of blockages using sonar sensors and obstacle detection systems
â€¢ Methane gas monitoring for safety hazards prevention
â€¢ Flame detection capabilities for fire hazard monitoring
â€¢ GPS location tracking with integrated map navigation
â€¢ Remote control of a plastic cutter mechanism via Firebase
â€¢ Live data synchronization using Firebase Realtime Database
â€¢ Modern, responsive UI with animated water level visualization

Technologies used:
â€¢ Android Development (Java)
â€¢ Firebase Realtime Database
â€¢ Material Design Components
â€¢ Sensor integration (Sonar, MQ-8 Gas sensor, IR sensors, Flame sensors)
â€¢ Google Maps API integration

This project demonstrates my proficiency in mobile app development, IoT integration, real-time data processing, and creating user-centric solutions for environmental challenges. The system provides city authorities with proactive tools to maintain drainage infrastructure and prevent flooding disasters.
